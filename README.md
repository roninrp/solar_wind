Solar Wind Speed Prediction using IPS data.

Solar winds are plasma hurtled away from the Sun and carries its magnetic field further away.
Their speeds (200km/s-800km/s) are not constant due to plsama interacting with magnetic fields generated in the process.

OMNI data is obtained from the satellite observing solar features at the L1 point between the Earth and the Sun.
This L1 point is partically considered on earth with regards to the Sun-Earth distance.

Task: To predict Solar Wind features like speed days before it hits L1/Earth.

IPS data: Inter-planetary Scintillation data are collected when radio telescopes observing distant radio sources 
have solar winds intercept their line of site. Few such radio telescopes can be used to determine solar wind speeds in transit to earth.
IPS data is primarily collected by Nagaoya University's Radio Telescopes.
